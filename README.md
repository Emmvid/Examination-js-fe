## This is a project where I've worked on using an API and creating different functions on a website. 


I've chosen to work with the Punk API, and I decided to not make a webshop, but a place to display the different beers and what food pairings they are supposed to be good with! 

I first started doing the HTML markup one way, but after struggling a lot to make it look nice and all of the functions to work, I decided to start from the beginning and attack the problems from a different side. This worked much better and I'm glad that I changed my mind and didn't continue with the first one. 

The user can add beers to a wishlist, take them of the wishlist, and load more beer with a button at the bottom of the page. There is also a back to top button.
